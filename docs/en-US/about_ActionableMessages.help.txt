SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains how to use the ActionableMessages PowerShell module to create interactive Adaptive Cards for use in Outlook and Microsoft 365.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The ActionableMessages module provides cmdlets for creating rich, interactive content that allows email recipients to take actions directly from within their email client without switching applications or context.

    ADAPTIVE CARDS BASICS
    ---------------------
    Adaptive Cards are a framework for exchanging card content in a common and consistent way. They automatically adapt to their host environment's look and feel while maintaining consistent behavior across different applications.

    Key components of an Adaptive Card:
    - Card: The root container for all content
    - Elements: Visual components like text blocks, images, columns, and containers
    - Actions: Interactive components like buttons that trigger specific behaviors
    - Inputs: Form fields for collecting user input

    BASIC WORKFLOW
    -------------
    1. Create a new card with New-AMCard
    2. Add elements to the card with Add-AMElement
    3. Export the card with Export-AMCard or Export-AMCardForEmail

    ORIGINATOR ID
    ------------
    Every ActionableMessages card requires a valid Originator ID, which is a GUID that identifies the sender. For production use, you must register with Microsoft to obtain an approved ID through the Actionable Email Developer Dashboard.

    For testing, you can use the test option available in the Actionable Email Developer Dashboard.

EXAMPLES
    Basic Card Creation:

    # Create a new card
    $card = New-AMCard -OriginatorId "your-originator-id"

    # Add elements
    $title = New-AMTextBlock -Text "Notification" -Size "Large" -Weight "Bolder"
    Add-AMElement -Card $card -Element $title

    $message = New-AMTextBlock -Text "This is an important notification." -Wrap $true
    Add-AMElement -Card $card -Element $message

    # Add an action
    $action = New-AMOpenUrlAction -Title "View Details" -Url "https://example.com"
    $actionSet = New-AMActionSet -Actions @($action)
    Add-AMElement -Card $card -Element $actionSet

    # Export
    Export-AMCard -Card $card -Path ".\notification.json"
